What you can do / check:

If you’re a user: Try accessing the affected service after some time, or check social media / service status pages for updates.

If you’re an AWS customer: Check the official AWS Health Dashboard: https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status

Consider whether your infrastructure has dependencies on the US-EAST-1 region — you may need to fail-over to other regions if you have such architecture.

If you tell me which specific service (“Amazon.com checkout”, “AWS console”, “EC2 instance”, etc.) is down for you, I can check whether that service is impacted or not.
